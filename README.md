# Profile
# Hi, I'm Anna üëã
- üåê 
I'm a data science enthusiast and educator with a lifelong passion for technology and learning. As an INTJ born in the early '80s, I've always been driven by curiosity and a logical approach to problem-solving. From my first computer at age 8 ‚Äî tinkering with DOS, Basic, and Windows 2.1 on dial-up ‚Äî to my current journey in data science, technology has been both my playground and my passion.

## About Me - üåê 

- **Early Beginnings:**  
  My fascination with technology began in the late 1980s. I still recall the excitment of logging onto AOL via dial-up. Then exploring the limitless possibilities of DOS, the Basic programing language and using Netscape, on an IBM PC in our home. These experiences set me on a path of perpetual curiosity and learning.

- **Educational Foundation & Career Transition:**  
  At the University of West Florida (1999‚Äì2002), I pursued Computer Information Systems while also majoring in Preschool/Primary Education. This unique blend laid the groundwork for a career where I merge technical innovation with a commitment to improving educational outcomes.

- **Analytical & Strategic Mindset:**  
  Being an INTJ, I‚Äôm naturally drawn to strategic thinking and logical analysis. Whether it‚Äôs interpreting complex data sets or developing streamlined solutions in the classroom, I bring a focused, detail-oriented approach to everything I do.
